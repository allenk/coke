# COKE

A light weight MVC framework base on [express](http://expressjs.com/). *NOTE : It is still under heavy development, you might not want to use it for now.



## Description

  `COKE` does not aim to be the `rails` for `node.js`. It does not add magic to `express`, instead it provides a better format for your project. It makes you easier to manage your code.



## Requires

  - node >= 0.4.x
  - java jre6 for [YUI-compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/) which is used on packing assets



## Installation

> Ubuntu install java jre6

    $ sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ferramroberto/java
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre

> Install `coke`

    npm install coke



## TODOs

- Adding more docs
